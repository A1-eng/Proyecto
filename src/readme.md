But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
pleasure and praising nice was born and I will give you a complete 
account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
 great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happ
iness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasur
 e rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful
 . Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtai
 n nice of itself, because it is nice, but because occasionally 
 circumstances occur in which toil and nice can procure him some
  great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
  laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advanta
  ge from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who choo
  ses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequenc
  es, or one who avoids a nice that produces no resultant pleasure
